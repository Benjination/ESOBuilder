- Real-time Features: WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database

Security Priorities:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for uploads and API calls
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Image metadata stripping
- User permission system
- API security and authentication
- Data encryption for sensitive information

Performance Priorities:
- Image optimization and compression
