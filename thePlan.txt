TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
=================================

GitHub Storage Architecture:
```
Repository Structure:
/storage/
  /users/
    /{userId}/
      /gallery/
        - image1.jpg
        - image2.png
      /builds/
        - build1-screenshot.jpg
      /avatar/
        - profile.jpg
  /community/
    /featured/
    /contests/
    /events/

URL Pattern:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/eso-theory-crafter-storage/main/users/user123/gallery/image1.jpg
```

GitHub API Integration:
```javascript
// Upload Service Example
const uploadToGitHub = async (file, path, userId) => {
  const content = await fileToBase64(file)
  const response = await octokit.repos.createOrUpdateFileContents({
    owner: 'username',
    repo: 'eso-theory-crafter-storage',
    path: `users/${userId}/gallery/${file.name}`,
    message: `Upload: ${file.name} by ${userId}`,
