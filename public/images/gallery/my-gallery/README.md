# My Gallery Directory

This directory will contain user-uploaded images once authentication is implemented.

## Structure:
- User images will be organized by user ID when database integration is complete
- Each user will have their own subdirectory
- Images will be automatically optimized and resized

## Current Status:
- Placeholder directory for Phase 4 implementation
- Will be populated when user accounts and file upload system are ready
